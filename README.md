# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

**Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular homework assignment, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

This was the purpose of this exercise. I have commented in the HTML and CSS files as well, BUT here is also the breakdown of the changes I made:

**HTML**
* Needed to add the actual title of the website, rather than have it as "website". 
* Needed to add id="search-engine-optimization" to fix the hyperlink. 

 **CSS** 
* Needed to consolidate to div .benefits rather than list each individually. It works both ways, but this is cleaner. 
* Needed to consolidate to h3 .benefits rather than list each individually. It works both ways, but this is cleaner. 
* Needed to consolidate to img .benefits rather than list each individually. It works both ways, but this is cleaner. 
* Needed to consoldidate some classes with commas rather than list them out. This method is cleaner. 
* Needed to consolidate the images since they have the same class rather than list them seperately. Again, this method is cleaner. 
* Needed to consolidate the h2 for the class .content as well.
